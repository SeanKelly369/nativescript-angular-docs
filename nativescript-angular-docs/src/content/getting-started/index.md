# Getting Started with NativeScript-Angular

NativeScript-Angular combines the power of Angular with native mobile development to create truly native iOS and Android applications.

## What is NativeScript-Angular?

NativeScript-Angular is a framework that allows you to build native mobile applications using Angular and TypeScript. Unlike hybrid frameworks that use WebViews, NativeScript-Angular provides direct access to native APIs and UI components, resulting in truly native performance and user experience.

## Key Features

- **Native Performance**: Direct access to native APIs without WebViews
- **Angular Integration**: Use familiar Angular concepts like components, services, and routing  
- **Cross-Platform**: Write once, run on both iOS and Android
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript support with strong typing
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Fast development with instant updates
- **Native UI**: Access to platform-specific UI components and styling
